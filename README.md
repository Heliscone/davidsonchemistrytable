# davidsonchemistrytable
Master Periodic Table for Chemistry and Advanced Chemistry. I have attempted to include the most relevant details needed for the Chemistry and Advanced Chemistry courses (the things that would normally be handwritten (shiver) on a table).
If you notice something that ought to be on the table, or anything subpar about this Periodic Table, please let me know!
This table is fully crafted in LaTeX, meaning that with a basic understanding of TiKZ and its node systems, you can rearrange and customize this table to your liking.
