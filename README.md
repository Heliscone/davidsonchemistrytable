# davidsonchemistrytable
Master Periodic Table for Chemistry and Advanced Chemistry. I have done my utmost to include every relevant detail needed for the Chemistry and Advanced Chemistry courses: formulas, constants, and details. 

However, I certainly do not guarantee that this periodic table will be sufficient for your needs, and recommend that you verify that you can locate every relevant formula. If you notice a formula/fact that is not on this table, please comment or email me.

Also, please note that I will be making significant changes to readability in the upcoming months.
